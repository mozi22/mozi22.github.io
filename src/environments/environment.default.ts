          '<p class="graf graf--p" name="d94a">Countries around the world are focusing more and more energy towards generating wealth leading them to take charge and an important position in world politics. Unlike before the industrial revolution when people used to work as artisans and farmers mostly, we&rsquo;ve accumulated wealth, used it in research and further our nationalistic ideologies.&nbsp;</p><p class="graf graf--p" name="c1cb">Since economic stability translates to a better life for the inhabitants, governments are finding ways to enhance their trade through different means, mostly through exports of goods and labor. But with the advent of new technologies, more channels can be established by countries to accumulate wealth which could be a blessing specially for the ones lagging behind. Cryptocurrencies and block chain technology can be leveraged by these countries to make a huge positive impact on their economies.&nbsp;</p><p class="graf graf--p" name="c4a1">If we look at the table shown below we can identify how countries like Nauru, Marshall Islands or Tonga could have used the technologies to rise above in GDP ranking. Multiple ways can be employed, the simplest being owning the bitcoin or a more difficult one being, to set up mining facilities.&nbsp;</p><p class="graf graf--p" name="0cd9">Getting their hands dirty in this area also can be a huge risk for the governments as the technology is still not completely stable and a loss at a government scale (which is massive) can move them even further towards the darkness in terms of economic stability. Therefore, not most of the governments are taking investments in crypto very seriously. But some of them are planning to use technology in other ways, like China launching digital Yuan being the first major government backed cryptocoin.</p><p class="graf graf--p" name="fcd6">Only time will tell how currencies around the world and blockchain technology can be used by smaller and larger governments for a further economic growth or a turnaround, but the success and failure stories coming out of them will have a lot for us to learn.&nbsp;</p>',

To understand how thresholds are calculated, imagine the country&rsquo;s total wealth to be distributed among the population as 100%. Different portions of this 100% will be received by different percent of the population (e.g 5% of the population is earning a slice of 10% of the total wealth which leaves 90% of the wealth to be distributed among the remaining 95% of the population ). The top 1% is usually owning a bigger slice of that 100%, let&rsquo;s say 30%. Simply dividing the wealth representing 30% (for e.g $100 billion) with the number of people representing the percentage of population (1% equivalent to 10,000 families) results in the threshold value.($10 million in this case).</p><p class="hi hj fr hk b hl ic hm hn ho id hp hq hr ie hs ht hu if hv hw hx ig hy hz ib dh ea" data-selectable-paragraph="" style="box-sizing: inherit; margin: 2em 0px -0.46em; font-weight: 400; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(41, 41, 41); font-style: normal; line-height: 32px; letter-spacing: -0.003em; font-family: charter, Georgia, Cambria, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 21px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Interestingly the thresholds calculated by Knight Frank are far lower than their calculated UHNWIs wealth. The country with the richest people in the world is Monaco and a threshold of only $7.9 million is required to be in that margin which sets up the goal of owning&nbsp;<strong class="hk cu" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-family: charter, Georgia, Cambria, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;">213.2 BTC&nbsp;</strong>to break into the top 1%. But if someone owns only half of BTC, this already counts the person among the richest 1% people in&nbsp;<strong class="hk cu" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-family: charter, Georgia, Cambria, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;">Kenya</strong>. Since owning a single BTC is not easy due to high prices there are other coins like polkadot and BNB that are still not out of grasp. During May 2021 the price of one BNB coin has been around $337.69 which is a 1872.48% increase from May 2020 price of&nbsp;<a class="bv ih" href="https://www.investing.com/crypto/binance-coin/bnb-usd-historical-data" rel="noopener nofollow" style="box-sizing: inherit; color: inherit; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;">$17.12</a>. If even less than half of the given rate is considered (i.e 900%) per year, it can take BNB around 2 years and some months to reach equivalent to the price of BTC which means one can already leave behind the richest people of several countries.</p><p class="hi hj fr hk b hl ic hm hn ho id hp hq hr ie hs ht hu if hv hw hx ig hy hz ib dh ea" data-selectable-paragraph="" style="box-sizing: inherit; margin: 2em 0px -0.46em; font-weight: 400; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(41, 41, 41); font-style: normal; line-height: 32px; letter-spacing: -0.003em; font-family: charter, Georgia, Cambria, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 21px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">A better overview of how many BTC and other cryptocurrencies can stack you against the richest people of different countries can be viewed in the following table.</p>',
